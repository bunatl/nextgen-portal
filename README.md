## Description
Portalo is an online web application that centralized your company's internal web applications and online tools into a single dashboard with a neat interface. From the dashboard, you can launch your applications/modules. Portalo's dashboard is hidden behind the login form powered by AWS Cognito. The user stays logged in until his logout. Unauthorized users get 403 and all mismatched routes result in 404. Furthermore, based on the logged user's privileges only corresponding applications (or part of the module) are shown to the user. 

Currently, only the human resources module is implemented. It retrieves and updates data stored in AWS DynamoDB (through GRAPHQL and AWS Lambda functions). Data are searched via the user's username in a search form that autocompletes/suggests user name/username. GUI uses Ant Design.

Since the backend is hosted on AWS whole application follows pay-as-you-use model.

### Live demo
This project is available on: [portalo.bunat.cz](https://portalo.bunat.cz/) using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) hosting & services.

### Context
*The project was created as part of the diploma thesis.*

### Author
[Lukas Bunat](https://bunat.cz)

## Usage
The application has a separate database (Cognito user pool) for login and the second one (DynamoDB) for info about users. Therefore, first register admin user that can create and edit other users' info. Admin should always create and fill users' info in the HR module and then let register user him/herself with the desired email. Cognito user pool and DynamoDB user bases are connected via username that is in email form.
### Login/register
1. On the register tab register user new
2. Confirm user in popup modal with confirmation code that is sent to the registration email
3. Login with registered username (email) and password

### Human resources module
1. `Manage HR` is shown only to admin users. This submodule allows to search users in DynamoDB with autocomplete feature. The user's info is then displayed and can be edited and saved. If a new username is added, the new user will be created in the DB.
2. Submodules `User info`, `Finances`, `Annual Leave` only display retrieved information from DynamoDB about currently logged-in user.
3. In all submodules user can ask by email to update his/her info.
